                Imagine in the country you live, the currency is only made up of 3 and 5 cent coins. Ignoring the question of why your country has only these two denominations, you might run into the situation of trying to get change for an 8 cent candy bar if you only have two 5 cent coins. You might give the store clerk 10 cents, but could you expect to get back your 2 cents of change? In this country, no you couldn't.
            </p>
            <p>
                In a 3 and 5 coin system, there are values of money that cannot be created such as 2, 3, 4, and 7 cents. But every value after that is obtainable if you have enough 3 and 5 cent coins.
            </p>
            <p>

                Trying to determine the largest monetary value <em>not</em> obtainable for a country's coin system is an example of the Frobenius Coin Problem. The answer to that question is called the <em>Frobenius Number</em>, named after Ferdinand Georg Frobenius. He was a German mathematician born February 14, 1877, in a suburb of Berlin. Frobenius worked on diverse fields such as elliptic functions, differential equations, number theory, and group theory and taught at the University of Berlin and the ETH Zurich.
            </p>
            <p>
                If there are only two denominations of coins \(x\) and \(y\), the Frobenius Number is given by the equation \(xy - x - y \). In our 3 and 5 cent system, the Frobenius number is \(3 \times 5 - 3 - 5 = 7\).
            </p>
            <p>
                For a three or more coin system, there is no explicit answer nor are there any fast and efficient computational algorithms for computing the answer.

            <h5>Generators</h5>
            <p>
                The coin denominations in a country's currency system are examples of generators as they can ``generate'' all possible values of money if you have enough coins.
            </p>
            <p>
                If your generators are 3 and 5, repeated addition of these numbers will result in the following first ten terms:

            </p>
            <p>
            	Every number except for 1, 2, 4, and 7 is in this list.
            </p>
            <p>
                Using mathematical notation we would write this set as
                \[
                    \langle 3, 5 \rangle = \{3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, \ldots \}
                \]
                where \( \langle 3, 5 \rangle\) denotes the set generated by 3 and 5.
            </p>
            <p>
                The numbers we cannot obtain are written as
                \[
                    \mathbb{Z^+} \setminus \langle 3, 5 \rangle = \{ 1, 2, 4, 7 \}
                \]
                where \(\mathbb{Z}^+\) is the set of positive integers. This set is finite which is an important observation we will come back to later.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is not always the case that the complement is finite. If we take 2 as a generator, we get all the positive even numbers. Its complement in the set of positive integers is not finite.

            <h5>Numerical Semigroups</h5>
            <p>
                By examining all the values we can create with whatever denominations of coins we have in our currency system, as long as the coins themselves don`t share any common factors, we have been creating a structure called a numerical semigroup.
            </p>
            <p>
                Formally, a <em>numerical semigroup</em> is a subset of the nonnegative integers with addition as the binary operation and a finite complement within the positive integers.
            </p>
            <p>
                Thus 3 and 5 create a numerical semigroup but 2 does not. In fact, all you need for a set of generators to create a numerical semigroup is for the generators to be relative prime, that is, they only share a common factor of 1.
            </p>
            <p>
                Next notice that every numerical semigroup has a set of generators. The easiest way to see this is to consider the smallest non-zero element in the semigroup. This element, together with all other elements in the semigroup that are not divisible by it, form a set of generators of the semigroup.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is because every element in the semigroup can be expressed as a linear combination of the generators with non-negative integer coefficients. Thus, every numerical semigroup does indeed have a set of generators.
            </p>
            <p>
                While every numerical semigroup contains a set of generators, the inverse that every set of generators creates a numerical semigroup is not always true. The even integers generated by 2 is an example of this.
            </p>
            <p>
                Numerical Semigroups are the main field of study for this article and while they might seem simple, there is a great deal to discover about them. To get started, we will lay out some definitions that will allow us to examine numbers, called invariants, that capture information about the structure of the semigroups.
            </p>

            <h5>Max and min factorization lengths</h5>
            <p>
                Let \( m_1, \ldots, m_n \) be a set of generators for the numerical monoid \( M \). Then, for any monoid element \(m \), the <em>set of factorizations of \(m \in M \)</em> is
                \[
                    \mathsf{Z}(m) = \left \{ (a_1, \ldots, a_k) \mid m =
                \sum_{i=1}^{k} a_im_i \right \}
                \]
                and the <em>set of factorization lengths of \(m \in M\)</em> to be

                \[
                    \mathsf{L}(m) = \left\{\sum_{i = 1}^{k} a_i : (a_1, \ldots,
                a_k) \in \mathsf{Z}(m)\right\}.
                \]
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, in the monoid generated by 2 and 3, the element 6 has the following two factorizations (3, 0) and (0, 2) since
                \[
                    (3, 0) \cdot (2, 3) = 3 \times 2 + 0 \times 3 = 6
                \]
                and
                \[
                    (0, 2) \cdot (2, 3) = 0 \times 2 + 2 \times 3 = 6
                \]
                where \( \cdot \) is the dot product operation from linear
                algebra. Thus
                \[
                    \mathsf{Z}(6) = \left \{ (3, 0), (0, 2) \right \}.
                \]
                The element 6 then has the set of factorization lengths of
                \[
                    \mathsf{L}(m) = \{ 3, 2 \}
                \]
                and it has a <em>maximum factorization length</em> 3 and a <em>minimum factorization length</em> of 2.
            </p>
            <p>
                An interesting question regarding these max factorization lengths is for any max factorization length k, how many monoid elements have that max factorization length?
            </p>
            <p>
                For example in the monoid generated by 2 and 3, 6 has a max factorization length of 3 but so does 5. By looking at the max factorization lengths for the nearby elements, it is the case that there are only two elements that have a max factorization length of 2.

            <h5>The Second Frobenius Number</h5>
            <p>
                Another situation that arises is how to use up all the change one collects usually in a kitchen catch-all drawer. If I know the price of something ahead of time, I might try to arrive at that value using the greatest number of coins possible. Thus, reducing the total number of coin I have at home. 
            </p>
            <p>
                If something cost 15 cents and I have many 3 and 5 cents coins, I could take to the store five 3 cent coins instead of only three 5 cent coins, which would get me closer to my goal of a coin free existence. In other words, we want to bring to the store the coins that have a max factorization length for a given value.    
            </p>
            <p>
            	In this example, 15 has a max factorization of five. Are there any other values that have that same max factorization length? Yes, 17 also have a max factorization length of five as
            	\[
            		4 \times 3 + 1 \times 5 = 17.
            	\]
            </p>
            <p>
            	Also, 19 has a max factorization length of five \(3 \times 3 + 2 \times 5 = 19 \). But 15, 17, and 19 are the only values that have a max factorization length of five. Furthermore, the number of elements that have a max factorization length of six is also three, as is the number of elements with a max factorization length of seven and so on. You would say the number of elements with a max factorization length of \(k\) stabilizes. In this numerical semigroup with 3 and 5 as generators, that number is three. 
            </p>
            <p>
                This raises an interesting question: given an arbitrary coin system with any number of denomination of coins, does the number of values of money you can create with a max factorization length of k always stabilize at some value. The answer is yes, and the number at which it stabilizes is called The Second Frobenius Number.
