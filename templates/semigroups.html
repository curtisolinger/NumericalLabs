                Imagine in the country you live, the currency is only made up of 3 and 5 cent coins. Ignoring the question of why your country has only these two denominations, you might run into the situation of trying to get change for an 8 cent candy bar if you only have two 5 cent coins. You might give the store clerk 10 cents, but could you expect to get back your 2 cents of change? In this country, no you couldn't.
            </p>
            <p>
                In a 3 and 5 coin system, there are values of money that cannot be created such as 1, 2, 4, and 7 cents. But every value after that is obtainable if you have enough 3 and 5 cent coins.
            </p>

                Trying to determine the largest monetary value <em>not</em> obtainable for a country's coin system is an example of the Frobenius Coin Problem. The answer to that question is called the <em>Frobenius Number</em>, named after Ferdinand Georg Frobenius. He was a German mathematician born February 14, 1877, in a suburb of Berlin. Frobenius worked on diverse fields such as elliptic functions, differential equations, number theory, and group theory and taught at the University of Berlin and the ETH Zurich.
            </p>
            <p>
                If there are only two denominations of coins \(x\) and \(y\), the Frobenius Number is given by the equation \(xy - x - y \). In our 3 and 5 cent system, the Frobenius number is \(3 \times 5 - 3 - 5 = 7\).
            </p>
            <p>
                For a three or more coin system, there is no explicit answer nor are there any fast and efficient computational algorithms for computing the answer.

            <h5>Generators</h5>
            <p>
                The coin denominations in a country's currency system are examples of so-called generators as they can ``generate'' all possible values of money if you have enough coins.
            </p>
            <p>
                If your generators are 3 and 5, repeated addition of these numbers will result in the following first ten terms:

            <p>
            	Every number except for 1, 2, 4, and 7 is in this list.
            </p>
            <p>
                Using mathematical notation we would write this set as
                \[
                    \langle 3, 5 \rangle = \{3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, \ldots \}
                \]
                where \( \langle 3, 5 \rangle\) denotes the set generated by 3 and 5.
            </p>
            <p>
                The numbers we cannot obtain are written as
                \[
                    \mathbb{Z^+} \setminus \langle 3, 5 \rangle = \{ 1, 2, 4, 7 \}
                \]
                where \(\mathbb{Z}^+\) is the set of positive integers. Notice, that this set is finite which is an important observation we will come back to later.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is not always the case that the complement is finite. If we take 2 as a generator, we get all the positive even numbers. Its complement in the set of positive integers is not finite.

            <h5>Numerical Semigroups</h5>
            <p>
                By examining all the values we can create with whatever denominations of coins we have in our currency system, as long as the coins themselves don`t share any common factors, we have been creating a structure called a numerical semigroup.
            </p>
            <p>
                Formally, a <em>numerical semigroup</em> is a subset of the nonnegative integers with addition as the binary operation and a finite complement within the positive integers.
            </p>
            <p>
                Thus 3 and 5 create a numerical semigroup but 2 does not. In fact, all you need for a set of generators to create a numerical semigroup is for the generators to be relative prime, that is, they only share a common factor of 1.
            </p>
            <p>
                Next notice that every numerical semigroup has a set of generators. The easiest way to see this is to consider the smallest non-zero element in the semigroup. This element, together with all other elements in the semigroup that are not divisible by it, form a set of generators of the semigroup.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is because every element in the semigroup can be expressed as a linear combination of the generators with non-negative integer coefficients. Thus, every numerical semigroup does indeed have a set of generators.
            </p>
            <p>
                While every numerical semigroup contains a set of generators, the inverse that every set of generators creates a numerical semigroup is not always true. The even integers generated by 2 is an example of this.
            </p>
            <p>
                Numerical Semigroups are the main field of study for this article and there is a great deal to discover about them. To get started, we will lay out some definitions that will allow us to examine numbers, called invariants, that capture information about the structure of a numerical semigroup.
            </p>

            <h5>Max and min factorization lengths</h5>
            <p>
                Let \( m_1, \ldots, m_n \) be a set of generators for the numerical semigroup \( M \). Then, for any semigroup element \(m \), the <em>set of factorizations of \(m \in M \)</em> is
                \[
                    \mathsf{Z}(m) = \left \{ (a_1, \ldots, a_k) \mid m =
                \sum_{i=1}^{k} a_im_i \right \}
                \]
                and the <em>set of factorization lengths of \(m \in M\)</em> to be

                \[
                    \mathsf{L}(m) = \left\{\sum_{i = 1}^{k} a_i : (a_1, \ldots,
                a_k) \in \mathsf{Z}(m)\right\}.
                \]
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, in the semigroup generated by 2 and 3, the element 6 has the following two factorizations (3, 0) and (0, 2) since
                \[
                    3 \times 2 + 0 \times 3 = 6
                \]
                and
                \[
                    0 \times 2 + 2 \times 3 = 6.
                \]
                Thus
                \[
                    \mathsf{Z}(6) = \left \{ (3, 0), (0, 2) \right \}.
                \]
                The element 6 then has the set of factorization lengths of
                \[
                    \mathsf{L}(m) = \{ 3, 2 \}
                \]
                and it has a <em>maximum factorization length</em> of 3 and a <em>minimum factorization length</em> of 2.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the following form, you can enter some generators and examine a particular semigroup element to see the set of factorizations and the max and min length for that element.

    		<h5>The Second Frobenius Number</h5>
            <p>
                An interesting question regarding these maximum factorization lengths is that for any max factorization length k, how many semigroup elements have that max factorization length?
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, in the semigroup generated by 2 and 3, the number 6 has a max factorization length of 3 but so does the number 7. In fact, these are the only two elements that have a max factorization length of 3.
            </p>
            <p>
                Then, for a max factorization length of 4, the only semigroup elements that have that factorization length are 8 and 9. Continuing, the only elements that have a max factorization length of 5 are 10 and 11. Therefore it appears that the number of elements with a given max factorization length is 2. 
            </p>
            <p>
                In fact, this is the case for a numerical semigroup generated by 2 and 3. For any max factorization length greater than 0, there will be 2 elements that have that max factorization length. We would say that the max factorization length <em>stabilizes</em> at 2. 
            </p>
            <p>
                This invariant where the max factorization length stabilizes at is called the <em>Second Frobenius number</em>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Does the max factorization length always stabilizes for any numerical semigroup? Yes it does. Most of the time for a given numerical semigroup, that max factorization length does not stabilize right away like it did with the semigroup generated by 2 and 3.
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, the semigroup generated by 21 and 22 doesn't stabilize until 21. 
            </p>
            <p>
                In the following interactive graph, you can enter in some generators and see where the max factorization length stabilizes. One the x-axis we have the max factorization length and on the y-axis, we have the number of elements that have that particular max factorization length.
