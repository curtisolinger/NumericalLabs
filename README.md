**Numerical Labs**

A community for mathematics students and professionals to showcase their work and research in an accessible way using interactive forms and graphics.

# Introduction

Numerical Labs started during my time working on my thesis for a Master's in Mathematics at San Francisco State University. I enjoyed my research but I also enjoyed explaining my research to non math students. I wanted to come up with a way to showcase my work in a manner that was simpler and clearer to understand than a typical mathematics research paper. I also thought this could be a portal for other researchers to present their work to the public in hopes of public education and to generate interest in the sciences. So far, we have only one research topic presented but we are always on the look out and encouraging others to post their work to the site. Help with the formatting and graphics is always available.

# Research Topic 1: Numerical Semigroups

A numerical semigroup is a subset of the nonnegative integers with finite complement. Every numerical semigroup contains a set of generators, that is, a minimal subset that when whose elements are added together repeatedly, create all the other elements of the semigroup.
